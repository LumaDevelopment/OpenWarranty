# OpenWarranty
An introductory PHP project centered around warranty. Currently unfinished and will likely not be finished.

Current Functions:
- Add Products
- Remove Products
- List Products
- Display Products

Needed Functions:
- Process Product Warranty Durations
- Create Warranty IDs
- Delete Warranty IDs
- Lookup Warranty ID
  - See Product
  - See Remaining Warranty Time
- Extend Warranty on ID/General Warranty Updating

This was a fun experiment but I've gotten the grasp/introductory knowledge of PHP that I wanted so I don't see the need to finish the functions. However, it might be fun to look through!
