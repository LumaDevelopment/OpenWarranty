# OpenWarranty
An introductory PHP project centered around warranty. Currently unfinished (and let's be real, probably never will be finished).

Current Functions:
- Add Products
- Remove Products
- List Products
- Display Products

Needed Functions:
- Process Product Warranty Durations
- Create Warranty IDs
- Delete Warranty IDs
- Lookup Warranty ID
  - See Product
  - See Remaining Warranty Time
- Extend Warranty on ID/General Warranty Updating

Quite frankly this was made to get familiar with PHP and should never be used for any reason other than as an example as how to not write secure PHP.
